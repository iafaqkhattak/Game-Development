 		<b><li>Objectives</li> </b>
 		<p>Hitman is an action-adventure stealth video game in which players control a genetically enhanced assassin called Agent 47  he carries out assassinations of various targets across the globe. players have a large amount of freedom in their approach to their assassinations. Players may use weapons including explosives, pistols, assault rifles, and long-range sniper rifles they may also assassinate the target at close range using bladed weapons or throwable items.</p>

 		<b> <li>Game Progressions </li></b>
 			<p>
 				Agent 47 is vulnerable in a firefight; thus, eliminating targets silently is preferred. He can use his specially equipped garrote wire to strangle his victims or disguise his killings as accidental deaths, such as poisoning the target's food or drowning them in a toilet. 47 can collect items to use as improvised weapons, access previously restricted areas, knock out enemies, or create distractions. Completion of mission challenges, such as killing targets in unconventional ways, discovering unique items, and gaining access to new areas, enables players to progress through the mastery levels for each location, with rewards such as advanced weapons and gadgets, agency pick-up locations for stashing gear, and new starting locations for that level.

 		<emp><h1>Mechanics </h1></emp>
 		<ol>
 		<b><li>Rules.</li></b>
 		<p> A player is usually told the personal details of their target as collected by the game host. The aim of the game is for players to track down and eliminate their targets until only one player remains. When a player eliminates their target, they get the victim's target(s). Only one assassin can kill a target at a time. If only one player remains, the game is over.</p>

 		<ul>
 		<li>the aim of the game is to collect as many points from kills as possible. The respawn means events are organised during the game to capture specific points.</li>

 		<li>("kills") remove a target from the game. What constitutes an elimination depends upon the particular rules set up by the game host. Eliminations might include hitting the target with an nerf gun </li>

 		<li>Some rules establish safe-zones, also known as Out of Bounds. A safe-zone is a place that protects a player from elimination. Safe-zones are declared by game hosts. At a university, safe zones might include classrooms during class periods.</li>

 		<li>Some games have "police forces", sometimes composed of eliminated players, whose job is to track down rule breakers. Some have time limits on eliminations and penalize players who are behind schedule in killing their targets.</li>

 		<b><li>Story</li></b>
 		
 		<p>
 			
 		Agent 47  a bald dude rocking a cute back-of-the-head barcode tattoo, wakes up in the basement of a creepy sanatorium (padded walls and all), and is guided through a training course by a mystery man talking through a loudspeaker. 47 shows off his athletic, firearm, and assassination skills; then, he shows off his sanatorium-guard-murdering skills and makes his escape.</p>

		<p>one year later. 47 is now a hitman (surprise, surprise) for the International Contract Agency (ICA). He’s got a super different new name (Agent 47) as well as a handler, Diana Burnwood, who you know you can trust thanks to her soothing British accent. Over the course of a year, 47 kills four different people—but don’t worry, they were totally evil so you don’t have to feel bad or anything. After killing his targets, 47 discovers that each of them had letters in their pockets talking about an experimental human, someone named Dr. Ort-Meyer, and—yikes—Agent 47 himself.</p>

		<p>Diana fills 47 in on some pretty startling news: all four of the guys he killed served together in the French Foreign Legion in Vietnam. The hits had all been ordered by the same person—a big no-no for the ICA. You know what that means! It’s time for One Last Job. 47 must assassinate a doctor in a Romanian sanatorium. (Coincidentally, it’s the one he broke out of a year prior. Weird!) After he finishes his mission, 47 realizes that the guy he just killed was Ort-Meyer’s assistant. He then learns that Ort-Meyer and the four guys he murdered earlier in the game had combined their DNA to create a perfect assassin: Agent 47 himself. (So, in a way, he kind of killed his dads. Well, most of them. Either way: whoops.)</p>

		<p>	With the assistance of CIA agent Carlton Smith, 47 tracks down his fifth dad, Ort-Meyer, and learns the truth: Ort-Meyer had orchestrated 47’s post-tutorial escape in order to see how he would fare IRL. He had also been the one to order the hits from earlier in the game so that he wouldn’t have to share 47 with the rest of the gang. Ort-Meyer also reveals that he’s since made some little brothers for 47—”Subjects 48,” a gaggle of clones that are easier to control and theoretically more skilled. (They aren’t actually more skilled, because 47 kills them.) 47 then tracks down and shoots Ort-Meyer. Before he dies, Ort-Meyer expresses regret for not recognizing his own son. 47, who apparently isn’t great at handling paternal affection, snaps his neck. So that probably means he’s done hitmanning forever, right?
