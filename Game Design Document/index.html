 		<b><li>Objectives</li> </b>
 		<p>Hitman is an action-adventure stealth video game in which players control a genetically enhanced assassin called Agent 47  he carries out assassinations of various targets across the globe. players have a large amount of freedom in their approach to their assassinations. Players may use weapons including explosives, pistols, assault rifles, and long-range sniper rifles they may also assassinate the target at close range using bladed weapons or throwable items.</p>

 		<b> <li>Game Progressions </li></b>
 			<p>
 				Agent 47 is vulnerable in a firefight; thus, eliminating targets silently is preferred. He can use his specially equipped garrote wire to strangle his victims or disguise his killings as accidental deaths, such as poisoning the target's food or drowning them in a toilet. 47 can collect items to use as improvised weapons, access previously restricted areas, knock out enemies, or create distractions. Completion of mission challenges, such as killing targets in unconventional ways, discovering unique items, and gaining access to new areas, enables players to progress through the mastery levels for each location, with rewards such as advanced weapons and gadgets, agency pick-up locations for stashing gear, and new starting locations for that level.

 		<ol>
 		<b><li>Rules.</li></b>
 		<p> A player is usually told the personal details of their target as collected by the game host. The aim of the game is for players to track down and eliminate their targets until only one player remains. When a player eliminates their target, they get the victim's target(s). Only one assassin can kill a target at a time. If only one player remains, the game is over.</p>

 		<ul>
 		<li>the aim of the game is to collect as many points from kills as possible. The respawn means events are organised during the game to capture specific points.</li>

 		<li>("kills") remove a target from the game. What constitutes an elimination depends upon the particular rules set up by the game host. Eliminations might include hitting the target with an nerf gun </li>

 		<li>Some rules establish safe-zones, also known as Out of Bounds. A safe-zone is a place that protects a player from elimination. Safe-zones are declared by game hosts. At a university, safe zones might include classrooms during class periods.</li>

 		<li>Some games have "police forces", sometimes composed of eliminated players, whose job is to track down rule breakers. Some have time limits on eliminations and penalize players who are behind schedule in killing their targets.</li>
